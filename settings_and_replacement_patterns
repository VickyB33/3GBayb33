Quality
{layer_height}	Layer Height	The height of each layer in mm. Higher values produce faster prints in lower resolution, lower values produce slower prints in higher resolution.
{layer_height_0}	Initial Layer Height	The height of the initial layer in mm. A thicker initial layer makes adhesion to the build plate easier.
{line_width}	Line Width	Width of a single line. Generally, the width of each line should correspond to the width of the nozzle. However, slightly reducing this value could produce better prints.
{wall_line_width}	Wall Line Width	Width of a single wall line.
{wall_line_width_0}	Outer Wall Line Width	Width of the outermost wall line. By lowering this value, higher levels of detail can be printed.
{wall_line_width_x}	Inner Wall(s) Line Width	Width of a single wall line for all wall lines except the outermost one.
{skin_line_width}	Top/Bottom Line Width	Width of a single top/bottom line.

{prime_tower_line_width}	Prime Tower Line Width	Width of a single prime tower line.
{initial_layer_line_width_factor}	Initial Layer Line Width	Multiplier of the line width on the first layer. Increasing this could improve bed adhesion.
Walls
{wall_extruder_nr}	Wall Extruder	The extruder train used for printing the walls. This is used in multi-extrusion.
{wall_0_extruder_nr}	Outer Wall Extruder	The extruder train used for printing the outer wall. This is used in multi-extrusion.
{wall_x_extruder_nr}	Inner Wall Extruder	The extruder train used for printing the inner walls. This is used in multi-extrusion.
{wall_thickness}	Wall Thickness	The thickness of the walls in the horizontal direction. This value divided by the wall line width defines the number of walls.
{wall_line_count}	Wall Line Count	The number of walls. When calculated by the wall thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.
{wall_transition_length}	Wall Transition Length	When transitioning between different numbers of walls as the part becomes thinner, a certain amount of space is allotted to split or join the wall lines.
{wall_distribution_count}	Wall Distribution Count	The number of walls, counted from the center, over which the variation needs to be spread. Lower values mean that the outer walls don't change in width.
{wall_transition_angle}	Wall Transitioning Threshold Angle	When to create transitions between even and odd numbers of walls. A wedge shape with an angle greater than this setting will not have transitions and no walls will be printed in the center to fill the remaining space. Reducing this setting reduces the number and length of these center walls, but may leave gaps or overextrude.
{wall_transition_filter_distance}	Wall Transitioning Filter Distance	If it would be transitioning back and forth between different numbers of walls in quick succession, don't transition at all. Remove transitions if they are closer together than this distance.
{wall_transition_filter_deviation}	Wall Transitioning Filter Margin	Prevent transitioning back and forth between one extra wall and one less. This margin extends the range of line widths which follow to [Minimum Wall Line Width - Margin, 2 * Minimum Wall Line Width + Margin]. Increasing this margin reduces the number of transitions, which reduces the number of extrusion starts/stops and travel time. However, large line width variation can lead to under- or overextrusion problems.
{wall_0_wipe_dist}	Outer Wall Wipe Distance	Distance of a travel move inserted after the outer wall, to hide the Z seam better.
{wall_0_inset}	Outer Wall Inset	Inset applied to the path of the outer wall. If the outer wall is smaller than the nozzle, and printed after the inner walls, use this offset to get the hole in the nozzle to overlap with the inner walls instead of the outside of the model.
{optimize_wall_printing_order}	Optimize Wall Printing Order	Optimize the order in which walls are printed so as to reduce the number of retractions and the distance travelled. Most parts will benefit from this being enabled but some may actually take longer so please compare the print time estimates with and without optimization. First layer is not optimized when choosing brim as build plate adhesion type.
{inset_direction}	Wall Ordering	Determines the order in which walls are printed. Printing outer walls earlier helps with dimensional accuracy, as faults from inner walls cannot propagate to the outside. However printing them later allows them to stack better when overhangs are printed. When there is an uneven amount of total innner walls, the 'center last line' is always printed last.
{alternate_extra_perimeter}	Alternate Extra Wall	Prints an extra wall at every other layer. This way infill gets caught between these extra walls, resulting in stronger prints.
{min_wall_line_width}	Minimum Wall Line Width	For thin structures around once or twice the nozzle size, the line widths need to be altered to adhere to the thickness of the model. This setting controls the minimum line width allowed for the walls. The minimum line widths inherently also determine the maximum line widths, since we transition from N to N+1 walls at some geometry thickness where the N walls are wide and the N+1 walls are narrow. The widest possible wall line is twice the Minimum Wall Line Width.
{min_even_wall_line_width}	Minimum Even Wall Line Width	The minimum line width for normal polygonal walls. This setting determines at which model thickness we switch from printing a single thin wall line, to printing two wall lines. A higher Minimum Even Wall Line Width leads to a higher maximum odd wall line width. The maximum even wall line width is calculated as Outer Wall Line Width + 0.5 * Minimum Odd Wall Line Width.
{min_odd_wall_line_width}	Minimum Odd Wall Line Width	The minimum line width for middle line gap filler polyline walls. This setting determines at which model thickness we switch from printing two wall lines, to printing two outer walls and a single central wall in the middle. A higher Minimum Odd Wall Line Width leads to a higher maximum even wall line width. The maximum odd wall line width is calculated as 2 * Minimum Even Wall Line Width.
{fill_outline_gaps}	Print Thin Walls	Print pieces of the model which are horizontally thinner than the nozzle size.
{min_feature_size}	Minimum Feature Size	Minimum thickness of thin features. Model features that are thinner than this value will not be printed, while features thicker than the Minimum Feature Size will be widened to the Minimum Wall Line Width.
{min_bead_width}	Minimum Thin Wall Line Width	Width of the wall that will replace thin features (according to the Minimum Feature Size) of the model. If the Minimum Wall Line Width is thinner than the thickness of the feature, the wall will become as thick as the feature itself.
{xy_offset}	Horizontal Expansion	Amount of offset applied to all polygons in each layer. Positive values can compensate for too big holes; negative values can compensate for too small holes.
{xy_offset_layer_0}	Initial Layer Horizontal Expansion	Amount of offset applied to all polygons in the first layer. A negative value can compensate for squishing of the first layer known as "elephant's foot".
{hole_xy_offset}	Hole Horizontal Expansion	Amount of offset applied to all holes in each layer. Positive values increase the size of the holes, negative values reduce the size of the holes.
{hole_xy_offset_max_diameter}	Hole Horizontal Expansion Max Diameter	When greater than zero, the Hole Horizontal Expansion is gradually applied on small holes (small holes are expanded more). When set to zero the Hole Horizontal Expansion will be applied to all holes. Holes larger than the Hole Horizontal Expansion Max Diameter are not expanded.
{z_seam_type}	Z Seam Alignment	Starting point of each path in a layer. When paths in consecutive layers start at the same point a vertical seam may show on the print. When aligning these near a user specified location, the seam is easiest to remove. When placed randomly the inaccuracies at the paths' start will be less noticeable. When taking the shortest path the print will be quicker.
{z_seam_position}	Z Seam Position	The position near where to start printing each part in a layer.
{z_seam_x}	Z Seam X	The X coordinate of the position near where to start printing each part in a layer.
{z_seam_y}	Z Seam Y	The Y coordinate of the position near where to start printing each part in a layer.
{z_seam_corner}	Seam Corner Preference	Control whether corners on the model outline influence the position of the seam. None means that corners have no influence on the seam position. Hide Seam makes the seam more likely to occur on an inside corner. Expose Seam makes the seam more likely to occur on an outside corner. Hide or Expose Seam makes the seam more likely to occur at an inside or outside corner. Smart Hiding allows both inside and outside corners, but chooses inside corners more frequently, if appropriate.
{z_seam_relative}	Z Seam Relative	When enabled, the z seam coordinates are relative to each part's centre. When disabled, the coordinates define an absolute position on the build plate.
Top/Bottom
{roofing_extruder_nr}	Top Surface Skin Extruder	The extruder train used for printing the top most skin. This is used in multi-extrusion.
{roofing_layer_count}	Top Surface Skin Layers	The number of top most skin layers. Usually only one top most layer is sufficient to generate higher quality top surfaces.
{roofing_line_width}	Top Surface Skin Line Width	Width of a single line of the areas at the top of the print.
{roofing_pattern}	Top Surface Skin Pattern	The pattern of the top most layers.
{roofing_monotonic}	Monotonic Top Surface Order	Print top surface lines in an ordering that causes them to always overlap with adjacent lines in a single direction. This takes slightly more time to print, but makes flat surfaces look more consistent.
{roofing_angles}	Top Surface Skin Line Directions	A list of integer line directions to use when the top surface skin layers use the lines or zig zag pattern. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again. The list items are separated by commas and the whole list is contained in square brackets. Default is an empty list which means use the traditional default angles (45 and 135 degrees).
{top_bottom_extruder_nr}	Top/Bottom Extruder	The extruder train used for printing the top and bottom skin. This is used in multi-extrusion.
{top_bottom_thickness}	Top/Bottom Thickness	The thickness of the top/bottom layers in the print. This value divided by the layer height defines the number of top/bottom layers.
{top_thickness}	Top Thickness	The thickness of the top layers in the print. This value divided by the layer height defines the number of top layers.
{top_layers}	Top Layers	The number of top layers. When calculated by the top thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.
{bottom_thickness}	Bottom Thickness	The thickness of the bottom layers in the print. This value divided by the layer height defines the number of bottom layers.
{bottom_layers}	Bottom Layers	The number of bottom layers. When calculated by the bottom thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.
{initial_bottom_layers}	Initial Bottom Layers	The number of initial bottom layers, from the build-plate upwards. When calculated by the bottom thickness, this value is rounded to a whole number.
{top_bottom_pattern}	Top/Bottom Pattern	The pattern of the top/bottom layers.
{top_bottom_pattern_0}	Bottom Pattern Initial Layer	The pattern on the bottom of the print on the first layer.
{connect_skin_polygons}	Connect Top/Bottom Polygons	Connect top/bottom skin paths where they run next to each other. For the concentric pattern enabling this setting greatly reduces the travel time, but because the connections can happen midway over infill this feature can reduce the top surface quality.
{skin_monotonic}	Monotonic Top/Bottom Order	Print top/bottom lines in an ordering that causes them to always overlap with adjacent lines in a single direction. This takes slightly more time to print, but makes flat surfaces look more consistent.
{skin_angles}	Top/Bottom Line Directions	A list of integer line directions to use when the top/bottom layers use the lines or zig zag pattern. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again. The list items are separated by commas and the whole list is contained in square brackets. Default is an empty list which means use the traditional default angles (45 and 135 degrees).
{small_skin_width}	Small Top/Bottom Width	Small top/bottom regions are filled with walls instead of the default top/bottom pattern. This helps to avoids jerky motions.
{skin_no_small_gaps_heuristic}	No Skin in Z Gaps	When the model has small vertical gaps of only a few layers, there should normally be skin around those layers in the narrow space. Enable this setting to not generate skin if the vertical gap is very small. This improves printing time and slicing time, but technically leaves infill exposed to the air.
{skin_outline_count}	Extra Skin Wall Count	Replaces the outermost part of the top/bottom pattern with a number of concentric lines. Using one or two lines improves roofs that start on infill material.
{ironing_enabled}	Enable Ironing	Go over the top surface one additional time, but this time extruding very little material. This is meant to melt the plastic on top further, creating a smoother surface. The pressure in the nozzle chamber is kept high so that the creases in the surface are filled with material.
{ironing_only_highest_layer}	Iron Only Highest Layer	Only perform ironing on the very last layer of the mesh. This saves time if the lower layers don't need a smooth surface finish.
{ironing_pattern}	Ironing Pattern	The pattern to use for ironing top surfaces.
{ironing_monotonic}	Monotonic Ironing Order	Print ironing lines in an ordering that causes them to always overlap with adjacent lines in a single direction. This takes slightly more time to print, but makes flat surfaces look more consistent.
{ironing_line_spacing}	Ironing Line Spacing	The distance between the lines of ironing.
{ironing_flow}	Ironing Flow	The amount of material, relative to a normal skin line, to extrude during ironing. Keeping the nozzle filled helps filling some of the crevices of the top surface, but too much results in overextrusion and blips on the side of the surface.
{ironing_inset}	Ironing Inset	A distance to keep from the edges of the model. Ironing all the way to the edge of the mesh may result in a jagged edge on your print.
{speed_ironing}	Ironing Speed	The speed at which to pass over the top surface.
{acceleration_ironing}	Ironing Acceleration	The acceleration with which ironing is performed.
{jerk_ironing}	Ironing Jerk	The maximum instantaneous velocity change while performing ironing.
{skin_overlap}	Skin Overlap Percentage	Adjust the amount of overlap between the walls and (the endpoints of) the skin-centerlines, as a percentage of the line widths of the skin lines and the innermost wall. A slight overlap allows the walls to connect firmly to the skin. Note that, given an equal skin and wall line-width, any percentage over 50% may already cause any skin to go past the wall, because at that point the position of the nozzle of the skin-extruder may already reach past the middle of the wall.
{skin_overlap_mm}	Skin Overlap	Adjust the amount of overlap between the walls and (the endpoints of) the skin-centerlines. A slight overlap allows the walls to connect firmly to the skin. Note that, given an equal skin and wall line-width, any value over half the width of the wall may already cause any skin to go past the wall, because at that point the position of the nozzle of the skin-extruder may already reach past the middle of the wall.
{skin_preshrink}	Skin Removal Width	The largest width of skin areas which are to be removed. Every skin area smaller than this value will disappear. This can help in limiting the amount of time and material spent on printing top/bottom skin at slanted surfaces in the model.
{top_skin_preshrink}	Top Skin Removal Width	The largest width of top skin areas which are to be removed. Every skin area smaller than this value will disappear. This can help in limiting the amount of time and material spent on printing top skin at slanted surfaces in the model.
{bottom_skin_preshrink}	Bottom Skin Removal Width	The largest width of bottom skin areas which are to be removed. Every skin area smaller than this value will disappear. This can help in limiting the amount of time and material spent on printing bottom skin at slanted surfaces in the model.
{expand_skins_expand_distance}	Skin Expand Distance	The distance the skins are expanded into the infill. Higher values makes the skin attach better to the infill pattern and makes the walls on neighboring layers adhere better to the skin. Lower values save amount of material used.
{top_skin_expand_distance}	Top Skin Expand Distance	The distance the top skins are expanded into the infill. Higher values makes the skin attach better to the infill pattern and makes the walls on the layer above adhere better to the skin. Lower values save amount of material used.
{bottom_skin_expand_distance}	Bottom Skin Expand Distance	The distance the bottom skins are expanded into the infill. Higher values makes the skin attach better to the infill pattern and makes the skin adhere better to the walls on the layer below. Lower values save amount of material used.
{max_skin_angle_for_expansion}	Maximum Skin Angle for Expansion	Top and/or bottom surfaces of your object with an angle larger than this setting, won't have their top/bottom skin expanded. This avoids expanding the narrow skin areas that are created when the model surface has a near vertical slope. An angle of 0° is horizontal and will cause no skin to be expanded, while an angle of 90° is vertical and will cause all skin to be expanded.
{min_skin_width_for_expansion}	Minimum Skin Width for Expansion	Skin areas narrower than this are not expanded. This avoids expanding the narrow skin areas that are created when the model surface has a slope close to the vertical.
Infill
{infill_extruder_nr}	Infill Extruder	The extruder train used for printing infill. This is used in multi-extrusion.
{infill_sparse_density}	Infill Density	Adjusts the density of infill of the print.
{infill_line_distance}	Infill Line Distance	Distance between the printed infill lines. This setting is calculated by the infill density and the infill line width.
{infill_pattern}	Infill Pattern	The pattern of the infill material of the print. The line and zig zag infill swap direction on alternate layers, reducing material cost. The grid, triangle, tri-hexagon, cubic, octet, quarter cubic, cross and concentric patterns are fully printed every layer. Gyroid, cubic, quarter cubic and octet infill change with every layer to provide a more equal distribution of strength over each direction. Lightning infill tries to minimize the infill, by only supporting the ceiling of the object.
{zig_zaggify_infill}	Connect Infill Lines	Connect the ends where the infill pattern meets the inner wall using a line which follows the shape of the inner wall. Enabling this setting can make the infill adhere to the walls better and reduce the effects of infill on the quality of vertical surfaces. Disabling this setting reduces the amount of material used.
{connect_infill_polygons}	Connect Infill Polygons	Connect infill paths where they run next to each other. For infill patterns which consist of several closed polygons, enabling this setting greatly reduces the travel time.
{infill_angles}	Infill Line Directions	A list of integer line directions to use. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again. The list items are separated by commas and the whole list is contained in square brackets. Default is an empty list which means use the traditional default angles (45 and 135 degrees for the lines and zig zag patterns and 45 degrees for all other patterns).
{infill_offset_x}	Infill X Offset	The infill pattern is moved this distance along the X axis.
{infill_offset_y}	Infill Y Offset	The infill pattern is moved this distance along the Y axis.
{infill_randomize_start_location}	Randomize Infill Start	Randomize which infill line is printed first. This prevents one segment becoming the strongest, but it does so at the cost of an additional travel move.
{infill_multiplier}	Infill Line Multiplier	Convert each infill line to this many lines. The extra lines do not cross over each other, but avoid each other. This makes the infill stiffer, but increases print time and material usage.
{infill_wall_line_count}	Extra Infill Wall Count	Add extra walls around the infill area. Such walls can make top/bottom skin lines sag down less which means you need less top/bottom skin layers for the same quality at the cost of some extra material. This feature can combine with the Connect Infill Polygons to connect all the infill into a single extrusion path without the need for travels or retractions if configured right.
{sub_div_rad_add}	Cubic Subdivision Shell	An addition to the radius from the center of each cube to check for the boundary of the model, as to decide whether this cube should be subdivided. Larger values lead to a thicker shell of small cubes near the boundary of the model.
{infill_overlap}	Infill Overlap Percentage	The amount of overlap between the infill and the walls as a percentage of the infill line width. A slight overlap allows the walls to connect firmly to the infill.
{infill_overlap_mm}	Infill Overlap	The amount of overlap between the infill and the walls. A slight overlap allows the walls to connect firmly to the infill.
{infill_wipe_dist}	Infill Wipe Distance	Distance of a travel move inserted after every infill line, to make the infill stick to the walls better. This option is similar to infill overlap, but without extrusion and only on one end of the infill line.

{retraction_min_travel}	Retraction Minimum Travel	The minimum distance of travel needed for a retraction to happen at all. This helps to get fewer retractions in a small area.
{retraction_count_max}	Maximum Retraction Count	This setting limits the number of retractions occurring within the minimum extrusion distance window. Further retractions within this window will be ignored. This avoids retracting repeatedly on the same piece of filament, as that can flatten the filament and cause grinding issues.
{retraction_extrusion_window}	Minimum Extrusion Distance Window	The window in which the maximum retraction count is enforced. This value should be approximately the same as the retraction distance, so that effectively the number of times a retraction passes the same patch of material is limited.
{retraction_combing}	Combing Mode	Combing keeps the nozzle within already printed areas when traveling. This results in slightly longer travel moves but reduces the need for retractions. If combing is off, the material will retract and the nozzle moves in a straight line to the next point. It is also possible to avoid combing over top/bottom skin areas or to only comb within the infill.
{retraction_combing_max_distance}	Max Comb Distance With No Retract	When greater than zero, combing travel moves that are longer than this distance will use retraction. If set to zero, there is no maximum and combing moves will not use retraction.
{travel_retract_before_outer_wall}	Retract Before Outer Wall	Always retract when moving to start an outer wall.
{travel_avoid_other_parts}	Avoid Printed Parts When Traveling	The nozzle avoids already printed parts when traveling. This option is only available when combing is enabled.

{retraction_hop_only_when_collides}	Z Hop Only Over Printed Parts	Only perform a Z Hop when moving over printed parts which cannot be avoided by horizontal motion by Avoid Printed Parts when Traveling.
{retraction_hop}	Z Hop Height	The height difference when performing a Z Hop.
{retraction_hop_after_extruder_switch}	Z Hop After Extruder Switch	After the machine switched from one extruder to the other, the build plate is lowered to create clearance between the nozzle and the print. This prevents the nozzle from leaving oozed material on the outside of a print.
{retraction_hop_after_extruder_switch_height}	Z Hop After Extruder Switch Height	The height difference when performing a Z Hop after extruder switch.

{cool_min_layer_time_fan_speed_max}	Regular/Maximum Fan Speed Threshold	The layer time which sets the threshold between regular fan speed and maximum fan speed. Layers that print slower than this time use regular fan speed. For faster layers the fan speed gradually increases towards the maximum fan speed.
{cool_fan_speed_0}	Initial Fan Speed	The speed at which the fans spin at the start of the print. In subsequent layers the fan speed is gradually increased up to the layer corresponding to Regular Fan Speed at Height.
{cool_fan_full_at_height}	Regular Fan Speed at Height	The height at which the fans spin on regular fan speed. At the layers below the fan speed gradually increases from Initial Fan Speed to Regular Fan Speed.
{cool_fan_full_layer}	Regular Fan Speed at Layer	The layer at which the fans spin on regular fan speed. If regular fan speed at height is set, this value is calculated and rounded to a whole number.
{cool_min_layer_time}	Minimum Layer Time	The minimum time spent in a layer. This forces the printer to slow down, to at least spend the time set here in one layer. This allows the printed material to cool down properly before printing the next layer. Layers may still take shorter than the minimal layer time if Lift Head is disabled and if the Minimum Speed would otherwise be violated.
{cool_min_speed}	Minimum Speed	The minimum print speed, despite slowing down due to the minimum layer time. When the printer would slow down too much, the pressure in the nozzle would be too low and result in bad print quality.

{cool_min_temperature}	Small Layer Printing Temperature	Gradually reduce to this temperature when printing at reduced speeds because of minimum layer time.

Increasing this reduces print time, but increases the area of support that rests on model
{support_tree_min_height_to_model}	Minimum Height To Model	How tall a branch has to be if it is placed on the model. Prevents small blobs of support. This setting is ignored when a branch is supporting a support roof.
{support_tree_bp_diameter}	Initial Layer Diameter	Diameter every branch tries to achieve when reaching the buildplate. Improves bed adhesion.
{support_tree_top_rate}	Branch Density	Adjusts the density of the support structure used to generate the tips of the branches. A higher value results in better overhangs, but the supports are harder to remove. Use Support Roof for very high values or ensure support density is similarly high at the top.
{support_tree_tip_diameter}	Tip Diameter	The diameter of the top of the tip of the branches of tree support.
{support_tree_limit_branch_reach}	Limit Branch Reach	Limit how far each branch should travel from the point it supports. This can make the support more sturdy, but will increase the amount of branches (and because of that material usage/print time)
{support_tree_branch_reach_limit}	Optimal Branch Range	A recomendation to how far branches can move from the points they support. Branches can violate this value to reach their destination (buildplate or a flat part of the model). Lowering this value will make the support more sturdy, but increase the amount of branches (and because of that material usage/print time)

{support_pattern}	Support Pattern	The pattern of the support structures of the print. The different options available result in sturdy or easy to remove support.
{support_wall_count}	Support Wall Line Count	The number of walls with which to surround support infill. Adding a wall can make support print more reliably and can support overhangs better, but increases print time and material used.
{support_interface_wall_count}	Support Interface Wall Line Count	The number of walls with which to surround support interface. Adding a wall can make support print more reliably and can support overhangs better, but increases print time and material used.
{support_roof_wall_count}	Support Roof Wall Line Count	The number of walls with which to surround support interface roof. Adding a wall can make support print more reliably and can support overhangs better, but increases print time and material used.
{support_bottom_wall_count}	Support Bottom Wall Line Count	The number of walls with which to surround support interface floor. Adding a wall can make support print more reliably and can support overhangs better, but increases print time and material used.
{zig_zaggify_support}	Connect Support Lines	Connect the ends of the support lines together. Enabling this setting can make your support more sturdy and reduce underextrusion, but it will cost more material.
{support_connect_zigzags}	Connect Support ZigZags	Connect the ZigZags. This will increase the strength of the zig zag support structure.
{support_infill_rate}	Support Density	Adjusts the density of the support structure. A higher value results in better overhangs, but the supports are harder to remove.
{support_line_distance}	Support Line Distance	Distance between the printed support structure lines. This setting is calculated by the support density.
{support_initial_layer_line_distance}	Initial Layer Support Line Distance	Distance between the printed initial layer support structure lines. This setting is calculated by the support density.
{support_infill_angles}	Support Infill Line Directions	A list of integer line directions to use. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again. The list items are separated by commas and the whole list is contained in square brackets. Default is an empty list which means use the default angle 0 degrees.
{support_brim_enable}	Enable Support Brim	Generate a brim within the support infill regions of the first layer. This brim is printed underneath the support, not around it. Enabling this setting increases the adhesion of support to the build plate.
{support_brim_width}	Support Brim Width	The width of the brim to print underneath the support. A larger brim enhances adhesion to the build plate, at the cost of some extra material.
{support_brim_line_count}	Support Brim Line Count	The number of lines used for the support brim. More brim lines enhance adhesion to the build plate, at the cost of some extra material.
{support_z_distance}	Support Z Distance	Distance from the top/bottom of the support structure to the print. This gap provides clearance to remove the supports after the model is printed. This value is rounded up to a multiple of the layer height.

{support_bottom_distance}	Support Bottom Distance	Distance from the print to the bottom of the support.
{support_xy_distance}	Support X/Y Distance	Distance of the support structure from the print in the X/Y directions.
{support_xy_overrides_z}	Support Distance Priority	Whether the Support X/Y Distance overrides the Support Z Distance or vice versa. When X/Y overrides Z the X/Y distance can push away the support from the model, influencing the actual Z distance to the overhang. We can disable this by not applying the X/Y distance around overhangs.

{support_bottom_stair_step_height}	Support Stair Step Height	The height of the steps of the stair-like bottom of support resting on the model.

{support_bottom_stair_step_width}	Support Stair Step Maximum Width	The maximum width of the steps of the stair-like bottom of support resting on the model. A low value makes the support harder to remove, but too high values can lead to unstable support structures.
{support_bottom_stair_step_min_slope}	Support Stair Step Minimum Slope Angle	The minimum slope of the area for stair-stepping to take effect.

Default is an empty list which means use the default angles (alternates between 45 and 135 degrees if interfaces are quite thick or 90 degrees).
{support_roof_angles}	Support Roof Line Directions	A list of integer line directions to use. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again.

Default is an empty list which means use the default angles (alternates between 45 and 135 degrees if interfaces are quite thick or 90 degrees).
{support_bottom_angles}	Support Floor Line Directions	A list of integer line directions to use. Elements from the list are used sequentially as the layers progress and when the end of the list is reached, it starts at the beginning again. The list items are separated by commas and the whole list is contained in square brackets. Default is an empty list which means use the default angles (alternates between 45 and 135 degrees if interfaces are quite thick or 90 degrees).

{support_supported_skin_fan_speed}	Supported Skin Fan Speed	Percentage fan speed to use when printing the skin regions immediately above the support. Using a high fan speed can make the support easier to remove.
{support_use_towers}	Use Towers	Use specialized towers to support tiny overhang areas. These towers have a larger diameter than the region they support. Near the overhang the towers' diameter decreases, forming a roof.
{support_tower_diameter}	Tower Diameter	The diameter of a special tower.

{support_mesh_drop_down}	Drop Down Support Mesh	Make support everywhere below the support mesh, so that there's no overhang in the support mesh.
{support_meshes_present}	Scene Has Support Meshes	There are support meshes present in the scene. This setting is controlled by Cura.
Build Plate Adhesion
{prime_blob_enable}	Enable Prime Blob	Whether to prime the filament with a blob before printing. Turning this setting on will ensure that the extruder will have material ready at the nozzle before printing. Printing Brim or Skirt can act like priming too, in which case turning this setting off saves some time.

Brim adds a single layer flat area around the base of your model to prevent warping. Raft adds a thick grid with a roof below the model. Skirt is a line printed around the model, but not connected to the model.
{adhesion_extruder_nr}	Build Plate Adhesion Extruder	The extruder train to use for printing the skirt/brim/raft. This is used in multi-extrusion.
{skirt_brim_extruder_nr}	Skirt/Brim Extruder	The extruder train to use for printing the skirt or brim. This is used in multi-extrusion.

{skirt_brim_minimal_length}	Skirt/Brim Minimum Length	The minimum length of the skirt or brim. If this length is not reached by all skirt or brim lines together, more skirt or brim lines will be added until the minimum length is reached. Note: If the line count is set to 0 this is ignored.
{brim_width}	Brim Width	The distance from the model to the outermost brim line. A larger brim enhances adhesion to the build plate, but also reduces the effective print area.
{brim_line_count}	Brim Line Count	The number of lines used for a brim. More brim lines enhance adhesion to the build plate, but also reduces the effective print area.
{brim_gap}	Brim Distance	The horizontal distance between the first brim line and the outline of the first layer of the print. A small gap can make the brim easier to remove while still providing the thermal benefits.
{brim_replaces_support}	Brim Replaces Support	Enforce brim to be printed around the model even if that space would otherwise be occupied by support. This replaces some regions of the first layer of support by brim regions.
{brim_outside_only}	Brim Only on Outside	Only print the brim on the outside of the model. This reduces the amount of brim you need to remove afterwards, while it doesn't reduce the bed adhesion that much.
{brim_inside_margin}	Brim Inside Avoid Margin	A part fully enclosed inside another part can generate an outer brim that touches the inside of the other part. This removes all brim within this distance from internal holes.
{brim_smart_ordering}	Smart Brim	Swap print order of the innermost and second innermost brim lines. This improves brim removal.
{raft_margin}	Raft Extra Margin	If the raft is enabled, this is the extra raft area around the model which is also given a raft. Increasing this margin will create a stronger raft while using more material and leaving less area for your print.
{raft_smoothing}	Raft Smoothing	This setting controls how much inner corners in the raft outline are rounded. Inward corners are rounded to a semi circle with a radius equal to the value given here. This setting also removes holes in the raft outline which are smaller than such a circle.
{raft_airgap}	Raft Air Gap	The gap between the final raft layer and the first layer of the model. Only the first layer is raised by this amount to lower the bonding between the raft layer and the model. Makes it easier to peel off the raft.
{layer_0_z_overlap}	Initial Layer Z Overlap	Make the first and second layer of the model overlap in the Z direction to compensate for the filament lost in the airgap. All models above the first model layer will be shifted down by this amount.
{raft_surface_layers}	Raft Top Layers	The number of top layers on top of the 2nd raft layer. These are fully filled layers that the model sits on. 2 layers result in a smoother top surface than 1.
{raft_surface_thickness}	Raft Top Layer Thickness	Layer thickness of the top raft layers.
{raft_surface_line_width}	Raft Top Line Width	Width of the lines in the top surface of the raft. These can be thin lines so that the top of the raft becomes smooth.
{raft_surface_line_spacing}	Raft Top Spacing	The distance between the raft lines for the top raft layers. The spacing should be equal to the line width, so that the surface is solid.
{raft_interface_layers}	Raft Middle Layers	The number of layers between the base and the surface of the raft. These comprise the main thickness of the raft. Increasing this creates a thicker, sturdier raft.
{raft_interface_thickness}	Raft Middle Thickness	Layer thickness of the middle raft layer.
{raft_interface_line_width}	Raft Middle Line Width	Width of the lines in the middle raft layer. Making the second layer extrude more causes the lines to stick to the build plate.
{raft_interface_line_spacing}	Raft Middle Spacing	The distance between the raft lines for the middle raft layer. The spacing of the middle should be quite wide, while being dense enough to support the top raft layers.
{raft_base_thickness}	Raft Base Thickness	Layer thickness of the base raft layer. This should be a thick layer which sticks firmly to the printer build plate.
{raft_base_line_width}	Raft Base Line Width	Width of the lines in the base raft layer. These should be thick lines to assist in build plate adhesion.

{raft_speed}	Raft Print Speed	The speed at which the raft is printed.
{raft_surface_speed}	Raft Top Print Speed	The speed at which the top raft layers are printed. These should be printed a bit slower, so that the nozzle can slowly smooth out adjacent surface lines.
{raft_interface_speed}	Raft Middle Print Speed	The speed at which the middle raft layer is printed. This should be printed quite slowly, as the volume of material coming out of the nozzle is quite high.
{raft_base_speed}	Raft Base Print Speed	The speed at which the base raft layer is printed. This should be printed quite slowly, as the volume of material coming out of the nozzle is quite high.
{raft_acceleration}	Raft Print Acceleration	The acceleration with which the raft is printed.

{prime_tower_wipe_enabled}	Wipe Inactive Nozzle on Prime Tower	After printing the prime tower with one nozzle, wipe the oozed material from the other nozzle off on the prime tower.
{prime_tower_brim_enable}	Prime Tower Brim	Prime-towers might need the extra adhesion afforded by a brim even if the model doesn't. Presently can't be used with the 'Raft' adhesion-type.
{ooze_shield_enabled}	Enable Ooze Shield	Enable exterior ooze shield. This will create a shell around the model which is likely to wipe a second nozzle if it's at the same height as the first nozzle.
{ooze_shield_angle}	Ooze Shield Angle	The maximum angle a part in the ooze shield will have. With 0 degrees being vertical, and 90 degrees being horizontal. A smaller angle leads to less failed ooze shields, but more material.
{ooze_shield_dist}	Ooze Shield Distance	Distance of the ooze shield from the print, in the X/Y directions.
{switch_extruder_retraction_amount}	Nozzle Switch Retraction Distance	The amount of retraction when switching extruders. Set to 0 for no retraction at all. This should generally be the same as the length of the heat zone.
{switch_extruder_retraction_speeds}	Nozzle Switch Retraction Speed	The speed at which the filament is retracted. A higher retraction speed works better, but a very high retraction speed can lead to filament grinding.
{switch_extruder_retraction_speed}	Nozzle Switch Retract Speed	The speed at which the filament is retracted during a nozzle switch retract.
{switch_extruder_prime_speed}	Nozzle Switch Prime Speed	The speed at which the filament is pushed back after a nozzle switch retraction.

Mesh Fixes
{meshfix_union_all}	Union Overlapping Volumes	Ignore the internal geometry arising from overlapping volumes within a mesh and print the volumes as one. This may cause unintended internal cavities to disappear.
{meshfix_union_all_remove_holes}	Remove All Holes	Remove the holes in each layer and keep only the outside shape. This will ignore any invisible internal geometry. However, it also ignores layer holes which can be viewed from above or below.
{meshfix_extensive_stitching}	Extensive Stitching	Extensive stitching tries to stitch up open holes in the mesh by closing the hole with touching polygons. This option can introduce a lot of processing time.
{meshfix_keep_open_polygons}	Keep Disconnected Faces	Normally Cura tries to stitch up small holes in the mesh and remove parts of a layer with big holes. Enabling this option keeps those parts which cannot be stitched. This option should be used as a last resort option when everything else fails to produce proper g-code.
{multiple_mesh_overlap}	Merged Meshes Overlap	Make meshes which are touching each other overlap a bit. This makes them bond together better.
{carve_multiple_volumes}	Remove Mesh Intersection	Remove areas where multiple meshes are overlapping with each other. This may be used if merged dual material objects overlap with each other.
{alternate_carve_order}	Alternate Mesh Removal	Switch to which mesh intersecting volumes will belong with every layer, so that the overlapping meshes become interwoven. Turning this setting off will cause one of the meshes to obtain all of the volume in the overlap, while it is removed from the other meshes.
{remove_empty_first_layers}	Remove Empty First Layers	Remove empty layers beneath the first printed layer if they are present. Disabling this setting can cause empty first layers if the Slicing Tolerance setting is set to Exclusive or Middle.
{meshfix_maximum_resolution}	Maximum Resolution	The minimum size of a line segment after slicing. If you increase this, the mesh will have a lower resolution. This may allow the printer to keep up with the speed it has to process g-code and will increase slice speed by removing details of the mesh that it can't process anyway.
{meshfix_maximum_travel_resolution}	Maximum Travel Resolution	The minimum size of a travel line segment after slicing. If you increase this, the travel moves will have less smooth corners. This may allow the printer to keep up with the speed it has to process g-code, but it may cause model avoidance to become less accurate.
{meshfix_maximum_deviation}	Maximum Deviation	The maximum deviation allowed when reducing the resolution for the Maximum Resolution setting. If you increase this, the print will be less accurate, but the g-code will be smaller. Maximum Deviation is a limit for Maximum Resolution, so if the two conflict the Maximum Deviation will always be held true.
{meshfix_maximum_extrusion_area_deviation}	Maximum Extrusion Area Deviation	The maximum extrusion area deviation allowed when removing intermediate points from a straight line. An intermediate point may serve as width-changing point in a long straight line. Therefore, if it is removed, it will cause the line to have a uniform width and, as a result, lose (or gain) a bit of extrusion area. If you increase this you may notice slight under- (or over-) extrusion in between straight parallel walls, as more intermediate width-changing points will be allowed to be removed. Your print will be less accurate, but the g-code will be smaller.
Special Modes
{print_sequence}	Print Sequence	Whether to print all models one layer at a time or to wait for one model to finish, before moving on to the next. One at a time mode is possible if a) only one extruder is enabled and b) all models are separated in such a way that the whole print head can move in between and all models are lower than the distance between the nozzle and the X/Y axes.
{infill_mesh}	Infill Mesh	Use this mesh to modify the infill of other meshes with which it overlaps. Replaces infill regions of other meshes with regions for this mesh. It's suggested to only print one Wall and no Top/Bottom Skin for this mesh.
{infill_mesh_order}	Mesh Processing Rank	Determines the priority of this mesh when considering multiple overlapping infill meshes. Areas where multiple infill meshes overlap will take on the settings of the mesh with the highest rank. An infill mesh with a higher rank will modify the infill of infill meshes with lower rank and normal meshes.
{cutting_mesh}	Cutting Mesh	Limit the volume of this mesh to within other meshes. You can use this to make certain areas of one mesh print with different settings and with a whole different extruder.
{mold_enabled}	Mold	Print models as a mold, which can be cast in order to get a model which resembles the models on the build plate.
{mold_width}	Minimal Mold Width	The minimal distance between the outside of the mold and the outside of the model.
{mold_roof_height}	Mold Roof Height	The height above horizontal parts in your model which to print mold.
{mold_angle}	Mold Angle	The angle of overhang of the outer walls created for the mold. 0° will make the outer shell of the mold vertical, while 90° will make the outside of the model follow the contour of the model.
{support_mesh}	Support Mesh	Use this mesh to specify support areas. This can be used to generate support structure.
{anti_overhang_mesh}	Anti Overhang Mesh	Use this mesh to specify where no part of the model should be detected as overhang. This can be used to remove unwanted support structure.
{magic_mesh_surface_mode}	Surface Mode	Treat the model as a surface only, a volume, or volumes with loose surfaces. The normal print mode only prints enclosed volumes. "Surface" prints a single wall tracing the mesh surface with no infill and no top/bottom skin. "Both" prints enclosed volumes like normal and any remaining polygons as surfaces.
{magic_spiralize}	Spiralize Outer Contour	Spiralize smooths out the Z move of the outer edge. This will create a steady Z increase over the whole print. This feature turns a solid model into a single walled print with a solid bottom. This feature should only be enabled when each layer only contains a single part.
{smooth_spiralized_contours}	Smooth Spiralized Contours	Smooth the spiralized contours to reduce the visibility of the Z seam (the Z seam should be barely visible on the print but will still be visible in the layer view). Note that smoothing will tend to blur fine surface details.
{relative_extrusion}	Relative Extrusion	Use relative extrusion rather than absolute extrusion. Using relative E-steps makes for easier post-processing of the g-code. However, it's not supported by all printers and it may produce very slight deviations in the amount of deposited material compared to absolute E-steps. Irrespective of this setting, the extrusion mode will always be set to absolute before any g-code script is output.
Experimental
{slicing_tolerance}	Slicing Tolerance	Vertical tolerance in the sliced layers. The contours of a layer are normally generated by taking cross sections through the middle of each layer's thickness (Middle). Alternatively each layer can have the areas which fall inside of the volume throughout the entire thickness of the layer (Exclusive) or a layer has the areas which fall inside anywhere within the layer (Inclusive). Inclusive retains the most details, Exclusive makes for the best fit and Middle stays closest to the original surface.
{infill_enable_travel_optimization}	Infill Travel Optimization	When enabled, the order in which the infill lines are printed is optimized to reduce the distance travelled. The reduction in travel time achieved very much depends on the model being sliced, infill pattern, density, etc. Note that, for some models that have many small areas of infill, the time to slice the model may be greatly increased.
{material_flow_temp_graph}	Flow Temperature Graph	Data linking material flow (in mm3 per second) to temperature (degrees Celsius).
{minimum_polygon_circumference}	Minimum Polygon Circumference	Polygons in sliced layers that have a circumference smaller than this amount will be filtered out. Lower values lead to higher resolution mesh at the cost of slicing time. It is meant mostly for high resolution SLA printers and very tiny 3D models with a lot of details.
{interlocking_enable}	Generate Interlocking Structure	At the locations where models touch, generate an interlocking beam structure. This improves the adhesion between models, especially models printed in different materials.
{interlocking_beam_width}	Interlocking Beam Width	The width of the interlocking structure beams.

{interlocking_beam_layer_count}	Interlocking Beam Layer Count	The height of the beams of the interlocking structure, measured in number of layers. Less layers is stronger, but more prone to defects.
{interlocking_depth}	Interlocking Depth	The distance from the boundary between models to generate interlocking structure, measured in cells. Too few cells will result in poor adhesion.
{interlocking_boundary_avoidance}	Interlocking Boundary Avoidance	The distance from the outside of a model where interlocking structures will not be generated, measured in cells.
{support_skip_some_zags}	Break Up Support In Chunks	Skip some support line connections to make the support structure easier to break away. This setting is applicable to the Zig Zag support infill pattern.
{support_skip_zag_per_mm}	Support Chunk Size	Leave out a connection between support lines once every N millimeter to make the support structure easier to break away.
{support_zag_skip_count}	Support Chunk Line Count	Skip one in every N connection lines to make the support structure easier to break away.

{draft_shield_dist}	Draft Shield X/Y Distance	Distance of the draft shield from the print, in the X/Y directions.
{draft_shield_height_limitation}	Draft Shield Limitation	Set the height of the draft shield. Choose to print the draft shield at the full height of the model or at a limited height.
{draft_shield_height}	Draft Shield Height	Height limitation of the draft shield. Above this height no draft shield will be printed.
{conical_overhang_enabled}	Make Overhang Printable	Change the geometry of the printed model such that minimal support is required. Steep overhangs will become shallow overhangs. Overhanging areas will drop down to become more vertical.
{conical_overhang_angle}	Maximum Model Angle	The maximum angle of overhangs after the they have been made printable. At a value of 0° all overhangs are replaced by a piece of model connected to the build plate, 90° will not change the model in any way.
{conical_overhang_hole_size}	Maximum Overhang Hole Area	The maximum area of a hole in the base of the model before it's removed by Make Overhang Printable. Holes smaller than this will be retained. A value of 0 mm² will fill all holes in the models base.
{coasting_enable}	Enable Coasting	Coasting replaces the last part of an extrusion path with a travel path. The oozed material is used to print the last piece of the extrusion path in order to reduce stringing.
{coasting_volume}	Coasting Volume	The volume otherwise oozed. This value should generally be close to the nozzle diameter cubed.
{coasting_min_volume}	Minimum Volume Before Coasting	The smallest volume an extrusion path should have before allowing coasting. For smaller extrusion paths, less pressure has been built up in the bowden tube and so the coasted volume is scaled linearly. This value should always be larger than the Coasting Volume.
{coasting_speed}	Coasting Speed	The speed by which to move during coasting, relative to the speed of the extrusion path. A value slightly under 100% is advised, since during the coasting move the pressure in the bowden tube drops.
{cross_infill_pocket_size}	Cross 3D Pocket Size	The size of pockets at four-way crossings in the cross 3D pattern at heights where the pattern is touching itself.
{cross_infill_density_image}	Cross Infill Density Image	The file location of an image of which the brightness values determine the minimal density at the corresponding location in the infill of the print.
{cross_support_density_image}	Cross Fill Density Image for Support	The file location of an image of which the brightness values determine the minimal density at the corresponding location in the support.
{support_conical_enabled}	Enable Conical Support	Make support areas smaller at the bottom than at the overhang.
{support_conical_angle}	Conical Support Angle	The angle of the tilt of conical support. With 0 degrees being vertical, and 90 degrees being horizontal. Smaller angles cause the support to be more sturdy, but consist of more material. Negative angles cause the base of the support to be wider than the top.
{support_conical_min_width}	Conical Support Minimum Width	Minimum width to which the base of the conical support area is reduced. Small widths can lead to unstable support structures.
{magic_fuzzy_skin_enabled}	Fuzzy Skin	Randomly jitter while printing the outer wall, so that the surface has a rough and fuzzy look.
{magic_fuzzy_skin_outside_only}	Fuzzy Skin Outside Only	Jitter only the parts' outlines and not the parts' holes.
{magic_fuzzy_skin_thickness}	Fuzzy Skin Thickness	The width within which to jitter. It's advised to keep this below the outer wall width, since the inner walls are unaltered.
{magic_fuzzy_skin_point_density}	Fuzzy Skin Density	The average density of points introduced on each polygon in a layer. Note that the original points of the polygon are discarded, so a low density results in a reduction of the resolution.
{magic_fuzzy_skin_point_dist}	Fuzzy Skin Point Distance	The average distance between the random points introduced on each line segment. Note that the original points of the polygon are discarded, so a high smoothness results in a reduction of the resolution. This value must be higher than half the Fuzzy Skin Thickness.
{flow_rate_max_extrusion_offset}	Flow Rate Compensation Max Extrusion Offset	The maximum distance in mm to move the filament to compensate for changes in flow rate.
{flow_rate_extrusion_offset_factor}	Flow Rate Compensation Factor	How far to move the filament in order to compensate for changes in flow rate, as a percentage of how far the filament would move in one second of extrusion.
{adaptive_layer_height_enabled}	Use Adaptive Layers	Adaptive layers computes the layer heights depending on the shape of the model.

{adaptive_layer_height_variation_step}	Adaptive Layers Variation Step Size	The difference in height of the next layer height compared to the previous one.
{adaptive_layer_height_threshold}	Adaptive Layers Topography Size	Target horizontal distance between two adjacent layers. Reducing this setting causes thinner layers to be used to bring the edges of the layers closer together.
{wall_overhang_angle}	Overhanging Wall Angle	Walls that overhang more than this angle will be printed using overhanging wall settings. When the value is 90, no walls will be treated as overhanging. Overhang that gets supported by support will not be treated as overhang either.
